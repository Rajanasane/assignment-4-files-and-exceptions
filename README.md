# Assignment 4: Files, Exceptions, and Errors in Python

## Module 5: Files, Exceptions, and Errors in Python

### Task 1: Read a File and Handle Errors

#### Problem Statement:
Write a Python program that:
1. Opens and reads a text file named `sample.txt`.
2. Prints its content line by line.
3. Handles errors gracefully if the file does not exist.

#### Expected Output:
- If the file exists:

Content of the file: Line 1 of sample.txt Line 2 of sample.txt ...


- If the file does not exist:

Error: The file does not exist.


### Task 2: Write and Append Data to a File

#### Problem Statement:
Write a Python program that:
1. Takes user input and writes it to a file named `output.txt`.
2. Appends additional data to the same file.
3. Reads and displays the final content of the file.

#### Expected Output:
---

- If the user enters some data, say "Python is fun":

Data written to file: Python is fun


- After appending additional data, say "I love programming":


Final content of the file: Python is fun I love programming
